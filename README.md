  ## Description:
My assignment is to modify starter code to create an application that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.  The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It's my job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

  # Installation

  # Usage
  Navigate to the project directory using a terminal and run 'node index.js'. This will kick off the inquirer script that will ask several questions about the employee and repeat as long
  as the user answers "yes" to having another employee to add. Once "No" is answered an html will be generated with cards showing the employees information labeled as "team.html".
